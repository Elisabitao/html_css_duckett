      <h1>Robot Wars!!!!!!</h1>
      <h3>Matilda...</h3><img src="./images_3/matilda.png" alt="robot wars" title="Because she is awesome!" align="left">
      <p>Matilda was originally designed to resemble a mutant robotic dinosaur. The only "Female" house robot, she was armed with front tusks and a rear chainsaw, she quickly became the house robot that was frequently attacked by competitors, climinating in her being practically destroyed by a competitor in The Fourth Wars Southern Annihilator. She returned for Extreme 1 having been rebuilt from the ground up. The tusks remained but her rear chainsaw was now interchangeable with a 27 kg flywheel. The chainsaw was never seen again during the UK series as the flywheel proved very effective against competitors making her one of the most dangerous robots in Robot Wars.</p>

      <p>Introduced in The Second Wars and built in only six weeks, Sir Killalot, or "Killalot" as he was affectionately known, was a semi-humanoid robot with a lance on one arm and pincers on the other. In The Third Wars the lance became a rotating drill and the strength of the hydraliic claw was improved For the Fourth Wars his hydraliic cutters were improved again becoming 3 times the size meaning grabbing robots was much easier. Until the introduction of Mr Psycho, Sir Killalot was considered the "king" of the house robots.</p>
