      <p id="paragraph 2">Paragraph to be placed here oh me oh my, but what is a word if it is not <b>bold and obvious?</b>, it matters not, for we can at least use <i>italics in its stead</i> is that not so?</p>
      <p>Here we shall show what uses              superscript can have, on the date 17<sup>th</sup> while also showing how subscript can work as well, <br />like in H<sub>2</sub>O....<br />aint this all fun and games....</p>

      <h2>New paragraph</h2>
      <p id="paragraph 2">Now I have to think of an abbreviation...how about <q>I always use a <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> for carrying my work around</q>. A <dfn>USB</dfn> is a small microchip that can store digital formats of documents <ins>and music</ins> <del>and such</del>. This is where <span class="for show">I need to reference something</span> like the fact that <cite>Game of Thrones</cite> by <em>George R. R. Martin</em> is <strong>awesome</strong>.</p>

      <h2>All about fantasy</h2>
      <p class="fantasy" id="paragraph 4">Fantasy is a genre of fiction that commonly uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary plot element, theme, or setting. <span class="for show">Many works within the genre take place in imaginary worlds where magic and magical creatures are common.</span> Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.</p>
      <p class="fantasy">The identifying traits of fantasy are the inclusion of fantastic elements in a self-coherent (internally consistent) setting, where inspiration from mythology and folklore remains a consistent theme. Within such a structure, any location of the fantastical element is possible: it may be hidden in, or leak into the apparently real world setting, it may draw the characters into a world with such elements, or it may occur entirely in a fantasy world setting, where such elements are part of the world. Essentially, fantasy follows rules of its own making, allowing magic and other fantastic devices to be used and still be internally cohesive.</p>
