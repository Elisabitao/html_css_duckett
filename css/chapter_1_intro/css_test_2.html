      <h1>One giant header coming up!</h1>
      <hr />
      <h6>and the smallest just for show</h6>
      <p>paragraph to be placed here oh me oh my, but what is a word if it is not <b>bold and obvious?</b>, it matters not, for we can at least use <i>italics in its stead</i> is that not so?</p>
      <p>Here we shall show what uses              superscript can have, on the date 17<sup>th</sup> while also showing how subscript can work as well, <br />like in H<sub>2</sub>O....<br />aint this all fun and games....</p>
      <p>This is where </blockquote>I will put <strong>strong emphasis</strong> on <q>my work</q> <br />and this is where I will put just <em>emphasis</em> on what Im writing about</p>
      <hr />
      <p>Now I have to think of an abbreviation...how about <q>I always use a <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> for carrying my work around</q>. A <dfn>USB</dfn> is a small microchip that can store digital formats of documents <ins>and music</ins> <del>and such</del>. This is where I need to reference something like the fact that <cite>Game of Thrones</cite> by <em>George R. R. Martin</em> is <strong>awesome</strong>.</p>

                  <p>Pickling process in India differs from other regions mainly due to additional spice mixture added to them post anaerobic fermentation. Pickles are main side dishes and many varieties of vegetables are used. However, raw mango or tender mango is the most popular variety of fruit used for pickling. There are multiple variety of mango pickles prepared depending on the region and the spices used but, broadly there are two types of - whole baby mango pickle or cut mango pickle. Whole baby mango pickle is a traditional variety very popular in Southern India and uses baby mangoes that are few weeks old. There are special varieties of mangoes specifically used just for pickling and they are never consumed as ripe fruit. Baby mangoes are pickled and added with spice mixture in a very careful process which ensures pickles are preserved for years.</p>
