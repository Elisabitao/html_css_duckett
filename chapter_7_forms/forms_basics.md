# FORMS

Forms are things that allow you to collect information from the user be it for shopping or data or search reasons.

The way a form works is as follows.....
* The user fills in the online form and presses a button
* The information is then sent to the server
    * The name of each form control is sent to the server along with the value entered or value selected
* The server then processes the information using a programming language such as PHP/ C#/ VB.net/ Java, AND may store the information in a database
* The server creates a new page to send back to the browser based on the information received

To differentiate between various pieces of inputted data, information is sent from the browser to the server in NAME/VALUE pairs, eg name:USERNAME = MERVE:value

Some examples of FORM CONTROLS include:
Text Input, Text Area, Password Input, Multiple Choices, Checkboxes, Dropdown Menus, Submission Buttons, Subscribe Buttons, and Uploading Options
