HTML BASICS
===========

HYPER TEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE

Structure is key, the headings and subheading denote hierarchy. HTML code itself is usually made up of elements aka 1 or 2 tags, such as <h1></h1>. The tags act like containers.

Attribute elements
They tell us more about the HTML element/ whats inside the tags, and are often made up of 2 parts: NAME and VALUE.
  eg. <p lang="eng-us">These paragraphs will be in English US because that is standard for code</p>

  HEAD
  TITLE
  BODY

  for example:

```bash
<html>
  <head>
    <title>The title of a page is displayed in the tabs section or title bar</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Anything displayed here in the body will be displayed on the browser</h1>
      <p>The 'head' is a separate thing altogether</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
