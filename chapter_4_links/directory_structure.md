DIRECTORY STRUCTURE + RELATIVE URLS
===================================

The ROOT folder is the 'mother branch' of the directory tree. There are 'parents' and 'children' of branches and therefore folders.

The homepage of a site written in HTML is called the INDEX aka the 'index.html' and sub-directories also contain 'index.html's as the homepage for that particular section.

RELATIVE URLS

Relative URLs are a shorthand way of writing URLs that are within the same website (i.e same website but different page within). They are also particularly useful when creating your own website as it means you can create them locally on your computer.

If you link the same page from 2 different pages you will probably need to write 2 separate relative URLs.

Simply write out the path required to access the 'child' folder, eg: <a href="films/dvds/reviews,html"></a> -> means you will be on your websites review page.

To access the parent or grandparent folder use the shorthand as in terminal, eg: <a href="../../reviews"></a> -> you will be on the root page or folder, in this case 'films'.
