# TABLES CONTINUED:

Long tables have 3 extra traits:

Headings of the table should sit inside the <thread> element
The body element should sit inside the <tbody> tag
And the footer belongs in the <tfooter>

One of the reasons to have a seperate <thead> and <tfooter> tag is so that if you have a table that is longer than the screen itself, the the header and the footer remain visible whilst the table contents scroll up or down.
