# TABLES BASICS

A table represents information in a grid format, which allow us to reference data via the two main axes. Each BLOCK = TABLE CELL. In html, each table is written out row by row.

The ```<table></table>``` element is used to create/ contain the table itself (much like the ```<body></body>``` element for what is shown on a browser) the contents of which as stated are written out row by row.
