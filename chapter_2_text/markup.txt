MARKUP
======

Markup is another term for tags or elements in HTML. There are 2 kinds, 'structural' and 'semantic'.
  STRUCTURAL : elements that are used to describe both headings and paragraphs
  SEMANTIC : provide extra information such as on the emphasis in a sentence etc

HTML has 6 basic heading sizes, like 'paper', the lower the number the larger it is - aka <h1></h1> is the <h1>BIGGEST</h1> with <h6></h6> being the smallest.

Paragraphs use the <p></p> tags and by default will start on a new line after each other even if in the code itself is back to back, provided they have their close.

```
