      <p1><h3>Here is the best of Dwarves:</h3><img src="http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130915151449/p__/protagonist/images/5/53/Grumpy-Disney.jpg" alt="Grumpy Dwarf" width="230" height="300" title="The only dwarf with any sense" height="110" width="150" align="left">He is perhaps the most capable and competent of the dwarfs. Perhaps for this reason, he seems to resent Doc's position as leader, often doubting Doc's capabilities. He is also notably annoyed by Dopey's antics, Bashful's shyness and Sneezy's nasal explosions. Though stubborn, he has a compassionate heart as any, though he rarely admits this. He's also shown to be quite intelligent, and rather fearless for the most part.</p1>
