#ESCAPE CHARACTERS

These are for when you want to use special characters or symbols.

It is important to check the page in your browser to ensure that the correct symbol shows up. This is because some fonts are not supported of all the characters available and you may have to use CSS instead.

There are more than one version of these symbols but for now...
