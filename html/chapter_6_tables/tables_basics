# TABLES BASICS

A table represents information in a grid format, which allow us to reference data via the two main axes. Each BLOCK = TABLE CELL. In html, each table is written out row by row.

The ```<table></table>``` element is used to create/ contain the table itself (much like the ```<body></body>``` element for what is shown on a browser) the contents of which as stated are written out row by row.

You indicate the start of each row with the ```<tr><tr>``` tag and for each cell you use the ```<td></td>``` tags.

(It is worth noting that some browsers plce lines around tables automatically, that said, CSS is the proper tool to use if that is the desired effect)

Headings for tables are created using ```<th></th>```, it is beat to use the scope element like you would use the `alt` element in the `img` tag; aka, in order to futher clarify what it is for, a `row` or `col`.

Column spans are adjusted using the ```colspan=""``` when used in the ```<td><td>``` tags, aka: ```<td>colspan="3"</td>```.
It is the same for spanning particular rows: ```<td>rowspan="2"</td>```.
