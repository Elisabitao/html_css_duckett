# PEOPLE AND THE WEB

People access the web through their browsers and it is important to remember that not everyone with have the updated version nor the same (aka old version of explorer, or chrome)

## Web servers:

When a request is sent out, aka, you ask your browser for a particular web page, the request itself is sent out to a special computer called a WEB SERVER. These are computers that not only host said website, but are also continuously connected to the internet and designed to send web pages out to the people who request them.
This is usually done by a WEB HOSTING company rather than the company themselves. They can be hosted anywhere in the world and are not location dependant. As a result, in order to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to the DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM server.

#### Web Steps and How!

  1. You connect to the internet using your ISP - internet service provider
  2. You open your choice of browser - chrome for example
  3. You request a site - bbc.co.uk
  4. Your computer contacts a network of servers called DNS servers - these act like a telephone book if you will, and tell your computer the correct IP address (the correct telephone number to access the correct computer server). They can be anything from 12 to 32 characters long!
  5. Your browser now contacts the web server that hosts your desired web page using the unique DNS number.
  6. The web server sends back the desired web page to the original browser

#### Screens:

For those who are visually impaired or need them for practical reasons such as while running etc, there are SCREEN READERS. Pretty self explanatory. As technology is developing the kind of devices used to read or surf the internet are becoming more and more varied, therefore making sure our web pages have RESPONSIVE design is crucial.

HTML and CSS are what a person sees on all websites, the more complex the page (eg, videos and animation etc the more likely it is that Java, Javascript, Ruby etc have also been used but for most, the more common website and user interface is just built on content- HTML, and visual design- CSS
